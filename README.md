# To run you'll need Node.js Version v14.17.0*
# *other verison may work but this is what it was tested on.
#
# You'll also need version ~90 or so of Chrome.
# If you have different version you'll need to match it in package.json
#
# to run:
# npm i
# npm run all
#
#
# Notes:
#
# Chose webdriver.io for ease of use, quick setup and built
# in features. Also is agnostic as to environment run in and 
# can run mobile, and many browsers.  
#
# I'm not 100% certain of all logic, but it appears that

# If you specify nickname you won't get the fullname back.
#
# If I connected to this project I'd likely ask some more
# questions to understand functionality better. 
#
# I could have pulled out the data, using json or database
# instead of hard coding the data values.
