# To run you'll need Node.js Version v14.17.0*
# *other verison may work but this is what it was tested on.
#
# You'll also need version ~90 or so of Chrome.
# If you have different version you'll need to match it in package.json
#
# to run:
# npm i
# npm run all
#

# Notes:

# you'll always get first initial present in generated name

# I could have pulled out the data, using json or database
# instead of hard coding the data values.
